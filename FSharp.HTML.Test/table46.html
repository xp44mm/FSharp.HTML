<table><tr><th>Method</th><th>Purpose</th></tr><tr><td>GetExportedNames([_exportStarSet_])</td><td>Return a list of all names that are either directly or indirectly exported from this module.</td></tr><tr><td>ResolveExport(_exportName_ [, _resolveSet_])</td><td><p>Return the binding of a name exported by this module. Bindings are represented by a<dfn id="resolvedbinding-record" variants="ResolvedBinding Records">ResolvedBinding Record</dfn>, of the form { [[Module]]: Module Record, [[BindingName]]: String | ~namespace~ }. If the export is a Module Namespace Object without a direct binding in any module, [[BindingName]] will be set to ~namespace~. Return *null* if the name cannot be resolved, or ~ambiguous~ if multiple bindings were found.</p><p>Each time this operation is called with a specific _exportName_, _resolveSet_ pair as arguments it must return the same result if it completes normally.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Link()</td><td><p>Prepare the module for evaluation by transitively resolving all module dependencies and creating a module Environment Record.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Evaluate()</td><td><p>Returns a promise for the evaluation of this module and its dependencies, resolving on successful evaluation or if it has already been evaluated successfully, and rejecting for an evaluation error or if it has already been evaluated unsuccessfully. If the promise is rejected, hosts are expected to handle the promise rejection and rethrow the evaluation error.</p><p>Link must have completed successfully prior to invoking this method.</p></td></tr></table>
