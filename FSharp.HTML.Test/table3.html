<table><tr><th>Internal Method</th><th>Signature</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>[[GetPrototypeOf]]</td><td>( )<b>→</b>Object | Null</td><td>Determine the object that provides inherited properties for this object. A *null* value indicates that there are no inherited properties.</td></tr><tr><td>[[SetPrototypeOf]]</td><td>(Object | Null)<b>→</b>Boolean</td><td>Associate this object with another object that provides inherited properties. Passing *null* indicates that there are no inherited properties. Returns *true* indicating that the operation was completed successfully or *false* indicating that the operation was not successful.</td></tr><tr><td>[[IsExtensible]]</td><td>( )<b>→</b>Boolean</td><td>Determine whether it is permitted to add additional properties to this object.</td></tr><tr><td>[[PreventExtensions]]</td><td>( )<b>→</b>Boolean</td><td>Control whether new properties may be added to this object. Returns *true* if the operation was successful or *false* if the operation was unsuccessful.</td></tr><tr><td>[[GetOwnProperty]]</td><td>(_propertyKey_)<b>→</b>Undefined | Property Descriptor</td><td>Return a Property Descriptor for the own property of this object whose key is _propertyKey_, or *undefined* if no such property exists.</td></tr><tr><td>[[DefineOwnProperty]]</td><td>(_propertyKey_, _PropertyDescriptor_)<b>→</b>Boolean</td><td>Create or alter the own property, whose key is _propertyKey_, to have the state described by _PropertyDescriptor_. Return *true* if that property was successfully created/updated or *false* if the property could not be created or updated.</td></tr><tr><td>[[HasProperty]]</td><td>(_propertyKey_)<b>→</b>Boolean</td><td>Return a Boolean value indicating whether this object already has either an own or inherited property whose key is _propertyKey_.</td></tr><tr><td>[[Get]]</td><td>(_propertyKey_, _Receiver_)<b>→</b><em>any</em></td><td>Return the value of the property whose key is _propertyKey_ from this object. If any ECMAScript code must be executed to retrieve the property value, _Receiver_ is used as the *this* value when evaluating the code.</td></tr><tr><td>[[Set]]</td><td>(_propertyKey_, _value_, _Receiver_)<b>→</b>Boolean</td><td>Set the value of the property whose key is _propertyKey_ to _value_. If any ECMAScript code must be executed to set the property value, _Receiver_ is used as the *this* value when evaluating the code. Returns *true* if the property value was set or *false* if it could not be set.</td></tr><tr><td>[[Delete]]</td><td>(_propertyKey_)<b>→</b>Boolean</td><td>Remove the own property whose key is _propertyKey_ from this object. Return *false* if the property was not deleted and is still present. Return *true* if the property was deleted or is not present.</td></tr><tr><td>[[OwnPropertyKeys]]</td><td>( )<b>→</b>List of property keys</td><td>Return a List whose elements are all of the own property keys for the object.</td></tr></table>
