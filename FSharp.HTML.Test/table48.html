<table><tr><th>Method</th><th>Purpose</th></tr><tr><td>InitializeEnvironment()</td><td>Initialize the Environment Record of the module, including resolving all imported bindings, and create the module's execution context.</td></tr><tr><td>ExecuteModule( [ _promiseCapability_ ] )</td><td>Evaluate the module's code within its execution context. If this module has *true* in [[HasTLA]], then a PromiseCapability Record is passed as an argument, and the method is expected to resolve or reject the given capability. In this case, the method must not throw an exception, but instead reject the PromiseCapability Record if necessary.</td></tr></table>
