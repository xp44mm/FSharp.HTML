<table><tr><th>Method</th><th>Purpose</th></tr><tr><td>HasBinding(N)</td><td>Determine if an Environment Record has a binding for the String value _N_. Return *true* if it does and *false* if it does not.</td></tr><tr><td>CreateMutableBinding(N, D)</td><td>Create a new but uninitialized mutable binding in an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. If the Boolean argument _D_ is *true* the binding may be subsequently deleted.</td></tr><tr><td>CreateImmutableBinding(N, S)</td><td>Create a new but uninitialized immutable binding in an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. If _S_ is *true* then attempts to set it after it has been initialized will always throw an exception, regardless of the strict mode setting of operations that reference that binding.</td></tr><tr><td>InitializeBinding(N, V)</td><td>Set the value of an already existing but uninitialized binding in an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. _V_ is the value for the binding and is a value of any ECMAScript language type.</td></tr><tr><td>SetMutableBinding(N, V, S)</td><td>Set the value of an already existing mutable binding in an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. _V_ is the value for the binding and may be a value of any ECMAScript language type. _S_ is a Boolean flag. If _S_ is *true* and the binding cannot be set throw a *TypeError* exception.</td></tr><tr><td>GetBindingValue(N, S)</td><td>Returns the value of an already existing binding from an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. _S_ is used to identify references originating in strict mode code or that otherwise require strict mode reference semantics. If _S_ is *true* and the binding does not exist throw a *ReferenceError* exception. If the binding exists but is uninitialized a *ReferenceError* is thrown, regardless of the value of _S_.</td></tr><tr><td>DeleteBinding(N)</td><td>Delete a binding from an Environment Record. The String value _N_ is the text of the bound name. If a binding for _N_ exists, remove the binding and return *true*. If the binding exists but cannot be removed return *false*. If the binding does not exist return *true*.</td></tr><tr><td>HasThisBinding()</td><td>Determine if an Environment Record establishes a `this` binding. Return *true* if it does and *false* if it does not.</td></tr><tr><td>HasSuperBinding()</td><td>Determine if an Environment Record establishes a `super` method binding. Return *true* if it does and *false* if it does not.</td></tr><tr><td>WithBaseObject()</td><td>If this Environment Record is associated with a `with` statement, return the with object. Otherwise, return *undefined*.</td></tr></table>
