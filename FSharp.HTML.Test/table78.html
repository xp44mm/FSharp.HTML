<table><tr><th>Property</th><th>Value</th><th>Requirements</th></tr><tr><td>*"done"*</td><td>a Boolean</td><td>This is the result status of an<em>iterator</em>`next` method call. If the end of the iterator was reached *"done"* is *true*. If the end was not reached *"done"* is *false* and a value is available. If a *"done"* property (either own or inherited) does not exist, it is considered to have the value *false*.</td></tr><tr><td>*"value"*</td><td>an ECMAScript language value</td><td>If done is *false*, this is the current iteration element value. If done is *true*, this is the return value of the iterator, if it supplied one. If the iterator does not have a return value, *"value"* is *undefined*. In that case, the *"value"* property may be absent from the conforming object if it does not inherit an explicit *"value"* property.</td></tr></table>
