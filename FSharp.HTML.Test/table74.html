<table><tr><th>Property</th><th>Value</th><th>Requirements</th></tr><tr><td>*"return"*</td><td>a function that returns an<i>IteratorResult</i>object</td><td>The returned object must conform to the<i>IteratorResult</i>interface. Invoking this method notifies the<i>Iterator</i>object that the caller does not intend to make any more `next` method calls to the<i>Iterator</i>. The returned<i>IteratorResult</i>object will typically have a *"done"* property whose value is *true*, and a *"value"* property with the value passed as the argument of the `return` method. However, this requirement is not enforced.</td></tr><tr><td>*"throw"*</td><td>a function that returns an<i>IteratorResult</i>object</td><td>The returned object must conform to the<i>IteratorResult</i>interface. Invoking this method notifies the<i>Iterator</i>object that the caller has detected an error condition. The argument may be used to identify the error condition and typically will be an exception object. A typical response is to `throw` the value passed as the argument. If the method does not `throw`, the returned<i>IteratorResult</i>object will typically have a *"done"* property whose value is *true*.</td></tr></table>
