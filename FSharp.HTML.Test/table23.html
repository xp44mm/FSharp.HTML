<table><tr><th>Method</th><th>Purpose</th></tr><tr><td>GetThisBinding()</td><td>Return the value of this Environment Record's `this` binding.</td></tr><tr><td>HasVarDeclaration (N)</td><td>Determines if the argument identifier has a binding in this Environment Record that was created using a |VariableDeclaration|, |FunctionDeclaration|, |GeneratorDeclaration|, |AsyncFunctionDeclaration|, or |AsyncGeneratorDeclaration|.</td></tr><tr><td>HasLexicalDeclaration (N)</td><td>Determines if the argument identifier has a binding in this Environment Record that was created using a lexical declaration such as a |LexicalDeclaration| or a |ClassDeclaration|.</td></tr><tr><td>HasRestrictedGlobalProperty (N)</td><td>Determines if the argument is the name of a global object property that may not be shadowed by a global lexical binding.</td></tr><tr><td>CanDeclareGlobalVar (N)</td><td>Determines if a corresponding CreateGlobalVarBinding call would succeed if called for the same argument _N_.</td></tr><tr><td>CanDeclareGlobalFunction (N)</td><td>Determines if a corresponding CreateGlobalFunctionBinding call would succeed if called for the same argument _N_.</td></tr><tr><td>CreateGlobalVarBinding(N, D)</td><td>Used to create and initialize to *undefined* a global `var` binding in the [[ObjectRecord]] component of a global Environment Record. The binding will be a mutable binding. The corresponding global object property will have attribute values appropriate for a `var`. The String value _N_ is the bound name. If _D_ is *true* the binding may be deleted. Logically equivalent to CreateMutableBinding followed by a SetMutableBinding but it allows var declarations to receive special treatment.</td></tr><tr><td>CreateGlobalFunctionBinding(N, V, D)</td><td>Create and initialize a global `function` binding in the [[ObjectRecord]] component of a global Environment Record. The binding will be a mutable binding. The corresponding global object property will have attribute values appropriate for a `function`. The String value _N_ is the bound name. _V_ is the initialization value. If the Boolean argument _D_ is *true* the binding may be deleted. Logically equivalent to CreateMutableBinding followed by a SetMutableBinding but it allows function declarations to receive special treatment.</td></tr></table>
