<table><tr><th>Internal Slot</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>[[Environment]]</td><td>an Environment Record</td><td>The Environment Record that the function was closed over. Used as the outer environment when evaluating the code of the function.</td></tr><tr><td>[[PrivateEnvironment]]</td><td>a PrivateEnvironment Record or *null*</td><td>The PrivateEnvironment Record for Private Names that the function was closed over. *null* if this function is not syntactically contained within a class. Used as the outer PrivateEnvironment for inner classes when evaluating the code of the function.</td></tr><tr><td>[[FormalParameters]]</td><td>a Parse Node</td><td>The root parse node of the source text that defines the function's formal parameter list.</td></tr><tr><td>[[ECMAScriptCode]]</td><td>a Parse Node</td><td>The root parse node of the source text that defines the function's body.</td></tr><tr><td>[[ConstructorKind]]</td><td>~base~ or ~derived~</td><td>Whether or not the function is a derived class constructor.</td></tr><tr><td>[[Realm]]</td><td>a Realm Record</td><td>The realm in which the function was created and which provides any intrinsic objects that are accessed when evaluating the function.</td></tr><tr><td>[[ScriptOrModule]]</td><td>a Script Record or a Module Record</td><td>The script or module in which the function was created.</td></tr><tr><td>[[ThisMode]]</td><td>~lexical~, ~strict~, or ~global~</td><td>Defines how `this` references are interpreted within the formal parameters and code body of the function. ~lexical~ means that `this` refers to the *this* value of a lexically enclosing function. ~strict~ means that the *this* value is used exactly as provided by an invocation of the function. ~global~ means that a *this* value of *undefined* or *null* is interpreted as a reference to the global object, and any other *this* value is first passed to ToObject.</td></tr><tr><td>[[Strict]]</td><td>a Boolean</td><td>*true* if this is a strict function, *false* if this is a non-strict function.</td></tr><tr><td>[[HomeObject]]</td><td>an Object</td><td>If the function uses `super`, this is the object whose [[GetPrototypeOf]] provides the object where `super` property lookups begin.</td></tr><tr><td>[[SourceText]]</td><td>a sequence of Unicode code points</td><td>The<emu-xref href="#sec-source-text">source text</emu-xref>that defines the function.</td></tr><tr><td>[[Fields]]</td><td>a List of ClassFieldDefinition Records</td><td>If the function is a class, this is a list of Records representing the non-static fields and corresponding initializers of the class.</td></tr><tr><td>[[PrivateMethods]]</td><td>a List of PrivateElements</td><td>If the function is a class, this is a list representing the non-static private methods and accessors of the class.</td></tr><tr><td>[[ClassFieldInitializerName]]</td><td>a String, a Symbol, a Private Name, or ~empty~</td><td>If the function is created as the initializer of a class field, the name to use for NamedEvaluation of the field; ~empty~ otherwise.</td></tr><tr><td>[[IsClassConstructor]]</td><td>a Boolean</td><td>Indicates whether the function is a class constructor. (If *true*, invoking the function's [[Call]] will immediately throw a *TypeError* exception.)</td></tr></table>
