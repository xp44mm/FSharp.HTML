<table><tr><th>Internal Method</th><th>Signature</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>[[Call]]</td><td>(<em>any</em>, a List of<em>any</em>)<b>→</b><em>any</em></td><td>Executes code associated with this object. Invoked via a function call expression. The arguments to the internal method are a *this* value and a List whose elements are the arguments passed to the function by a call expression. Objects that implement this internal method are<em>callable</em>.</td></tr><tr><td>[[Construct]]</td><td>(a List of<em>any</em>, Object)<b>→</b>Object</td><td>Creates an object. Invoked via the `new` operator or a `super` call. The first argument to the internal method is a List whose elements are the arguments of the constructor invocation or the `super` call. The second argument is the object to which the `new` operator was initially applied. Objects that implement this internal method are called<em>constructors</em>. A function object is not necessarily a constructor and such non-constructor function objects do not have a [[Construct]] internal method.</td></tr></table>
