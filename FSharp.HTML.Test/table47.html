<table><tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Value Type</th><th>Meaning</th></tr><tr><td>[[Status]]</td><td>~unlinked~, ~linking~, ~linked~, ~evaluating~, ~evaluating-async~, or ~evaluated~</td><td>Initially ~unlinked~. Transitions to ~linking~, ~linked~, ~evaluating~, possibly ~evaluating-async~, ~evaluated~ (in that order) as the module progresses throughout its lifecycle. ~evaluating-async~ indicates this module is queued to execute on completion of its asynchronous dependencies or it is a module whose [[HasTLA]] field is *true* that has been executed and is pending top-level completion.</td></tr><tr><td>[[EvaluationError]]</td><td>an abrupt completion or ~empty~</td><td>A throw completion representing the exception that occurred during evaluation. *undefined* if no exception occurred or if [[Status]] is not ~evaluated~.</td></tr><tr><td>[[DFSIndex]]</td><td>an integer or ~empty~</td><td>Auxiliary field used during Link and Evaluate only. If [[Status]] is ~linking~ or ~evaluating~, this non-negative number records the point at which the module was first visited during the depth-first traversal of the dependency graph.</td></tr><tr><td>[[DFSAncestorIndex]]</td><td>an integer or ~empty~</td><td>Auxiliary field used during Link and Evaluate only. If [[Status]] is ~linking~ or ~evaluating~, this is either the module's own [[DFSIndex]] or that of an "earlier" module in the same strongly connected component.</td></tr><tr><td>[[RequestedModules]]</td><td>a List of Strings</td><td>A List of all the |ModuleSpecifier| strings used by the module represented by this record to request the importation of a module. The List is source text occurrence ordered.</td></tr><tr><td>[[CycleRoot]]</td><td>a Cyclic Module Record or ~empty~</td><td>The first visited module of the cycle, the root DFS ancestor of the strongly connected component. For a module not in a cycle this would be the module itself. Once Evaluate has completed, a module's [[DFSAncestorIndex]] is equal to the [[DFSIndex]] of its [[CycleRoot]].</td></tr><tr><td>[[HasTLA]]</td><td>a Boolean</td><td>Whether this module is individually asynchronous (for example, if it's a Source Text Module Record containing a top-level await). Having an asynchronous dependency does not mean this field is *true*. This field must not change after the module is parsed.</td></tr><tr><td>[[AsyncEvaluation]]</td><td>a Boolean</td><td>Whether this module is either itself asynchronous or has an asynchronous dependency. Note: The order in which this field is set is used to order queued executions, see<emu-xref href="#sec-async-module-execution-fulfilled"/>.</td></tr><tr><td>[[TopLevelCapability]]</td><td>a PromiseCapability Record or ~empty~</td><td>If this module is the [[CycleRoot]] of some cycle, and Evaluate() was called on some module in that cycle, this field contains the PromiseCapability Record for that entire evaluation. It is used to settle the Promise object that is returned from the Evaluate() abstract method. This field will be ~empty~ for any dependencies of that module, unless a top-level Evaluate() has been initiated for some of those dependencies.</td></tr><tr><td>[[AsyncParentModules]]</td><td>a List of Cyclic Module Records</td><td>If this module or a dependency has [[HasTLA]] *true*, and execution is in progress, this tracks the parent importers of this module for the top-level execution job. These parent modules will not start executing before this module has successfully completed execution.</td></tr><tr><td>[[PendingAsyncDependencies]]</td><td>an integer or ~empty~</td><td>If this module has any asynchronous dependencies, this tracks the number of asynchronous dependency modules remaining to execute for this module. A module with asynchronous dependencies will be executed when this field reaches 0 and there are no execution errors.</td></tr></table>
