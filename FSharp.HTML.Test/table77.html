If the argument value is used in the typical manner, then if it is a rejected promise, a promise rejected with the same reason should be returned; if it is a fulfilled promise, then its fulfillment value should be used as the *"value"* property of the returned promise's<i>IteratorResult</i>object fulfillment value.

Invoking this method notifies the<i>AsyncIterator</i>object that the caller has detected an error condition. The argument may be used to identify the error condition and typically will be an exception object.
